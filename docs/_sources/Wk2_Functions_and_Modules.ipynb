    "# Functions and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "As we established last week, one of the main reasons that we use programming languages is to make our workflow more efficient. We use functions and modules to do just this - they are used to save us time by eliminating the need to write the same bits of code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are comfortable defining variables, we should briefly consider variable names. From the assigned variable name it should be clear what the variable represents, for example, if I set a variable equal to the age of my car, a good name could be “carAge”, whereas a less useful name might be “ca”. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above I used camel case for my variable name and this is a good style convention to adopt. When using camel case the first word of the variable is lowercase, and rather than using spaces, we highlight the start of a new word using a capital letter e.g. thisIsAnExampleOfHowWeCanUseCamalCase. Alternatively, we may wish to use snake case: this_is_where_we_use_underscores. Typically when using snake case all letters are lowercase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that Python is case sensitive - “variable1” is not the same as “Variable1”. Variable names must always start with a letter.\n",
    "\n",
