    "One of the most ubiquitous data structures is the array.  An array is a matrix of numbers that can be any number of dimensions. For now, we will only use 2D arrays to make visualising them easier. We will use a type of array called a Numpy Array, this is very common and used by nearly everyone. To use numpy we have to import the numpy library into Python to give us access to the array commands. To do this we simply write an import command at the top of our Python script."
