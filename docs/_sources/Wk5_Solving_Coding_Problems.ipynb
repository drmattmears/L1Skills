When using StackOverflow it is important to make sure that you read through the original post and the proposed solutions to determine how applicable they are to  solving your problem. It may be the case that you can simply take the code provided to solve a simple problem, or you may need to study the code line-by-line to understand what the provided code is doing and how it may be modified for your use.

    "\n",
    "Many times the error we encounter will be related to the arguments required for an imported function or package - to debug these errors we may need to consult appropriate documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you first encounter this type of material it can appear somewhat inaccessible and intimidating, but let's inspect the typical anatomy of Python documentation so that we may feel more comfortable using it to solve our coding problems. Let’s take a look at the [scipy.stats.linregress documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](Wk5_Figures/Documentation1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very top of the page we can see the package that the linregress function comes from - scipy.stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this we see an example of how one would type the function into their code and the arguments that they would need to include, for example, we are told that the x and y parameters are required and that these each need to be array_like (i.e. we need a list of x and y data points). You may note that the documentation outlines that we may set “y=None” if our x array is 2 dimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example there is the “alternative” argument, which by default is set as “two-sided” but can be changed to “less” or “greater” if we want to ensure that the gradient of the line is less than or greater than zero, respectfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all of the information we need for us to be able to use the linregress function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](Wk5_Figures/Documentation2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the parameters are the returns (see above) - these being all of the parameters that we can extract from the linregress function once it has successfully fit out data. From the documentation we can see that our “result” is an object with several attributes: the slope, intercept, rvalue, pvalue, stderr, and inctercept_stderr, and that each of these values are float types. Each attribute is accompanied by a description of what it is for user ease. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an added bonus, the documentation also references similar functions that may be of use to us - this can be particularly useful when we are trying to do something specific, but do not know if a function exists/the name of a function needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the documentation outlines any specific notes to be aware of - in this case the different ways in which we can extract our fit information, note only one method allows us to determine the intercept standard error…\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](Wk5_Figures/Documentation3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and perhaps most usefully, at the end of the documentation we are typically given examples of how to use the code that we are reading about. This may be accompanied by  an example output of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](Wk5_Figures/Documentation4.png)\n",
    "![image](Wk5_Figures/Documentation5.png)\n",
    "\n",
