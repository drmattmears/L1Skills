# Welcome to PHYS11006 Computing Skills

All scientists develop a large number of skills as part of their training. Many of these skills are shared between the disciplines of physics, biology and chemistry. For example, every scientist is expected to have developed skills in:

-  computer programming,
-  statistical analysis,
-  communication of results.

Whilst it is imperative to have a firm grasp of these skills to be a proficient scientist, they are also highly transferable and will likely be utilised in your future endeavours, regardless of whether you decide to pursue a career in industry or academia. Investing time in developing these skills at the start of your degree is the key to being successful, particularly as these skills are essential at levels 2 and 3 to achieve a strong degree classification. 


The workshops will provide the opportunity to develop these skills with the support of academics and teaching assistants through a combination of taught sessions, assignments and feedback. Each week three hours are timetabled for the workshops, which will typically be split into two blocks. Each block will focus on one particular skill or topic related to either computing and analysis or scientific communication. 


The structure of the course has been designed so that you have the opportunity to develop skills in the workshop before applying them in other areas of the programme (e.g. developing analysis or writing skills that may then be applied when completing lab assignments). During some weeks free blocks are timetabled, these have purposefully been included so that you may decide which skills or topics you wish to receive additional support with. For example, free sessions may be used to recap previously covered materials or to complete analysis and writing assignments related to the labs.

I hope you enjoy the workshops!
